<p>As you can see, I digress&hellip; A lot&hellip;</p>
<p>Apart from Ai, I like to play Tennis, watch Formula 1, biking, street art, photography. Apparently, World Travel is not on that list. My long term goal with this project is to become better at writing, teaching, and presenting technical topics.</p>
<p>I am a Graduate Student at <em>University of Cincinnati</em> studying Mechanical Engineering.</p>
